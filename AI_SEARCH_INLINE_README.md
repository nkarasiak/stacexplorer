   - Responsive design and dark theme support
   - Integration with existing card aesthetic

3. **`test-ai-search-inline.html`**
   - Standalone test page for the inline component
   - Includes mock services and testing controls

### üìù Modified Files

1. **`index.html`**
   - Replaced card HTML with inline AI search container
   - Added hidden form elements for backward compatibility
   - Added CSS import for inline styles

2. **`js/app.js`**

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Select Dataset**: Click "EVERYTHING" to choose specific collections or search all
2. **Set Location**: Click "THE WORLD" to define area of interest
3. **Pick Time**: Click "ANYTIME" to set date range
4. **Adjust Parameters**: Click to modify cloud cover and filters
5. **Search**: Click the search button to execute

### Advanced Features

- **Paste Geometry**: Paste WKT or GeoJSON anywhere - it's automatically detected
- **Draw on Map**: Use the drawing tool to visually select areas
- **Location Search**: Search for places by name (cities, countries, etc.)
- **Multi-Source Search**: Search across all data sources simultaneously

## Testing

### Run Standalone Test

Open `test-ai-search-inline.html` in your browser to test the inline component with mock services.

### Test in Main Application

1. Start your development server
2. Open the main application
3. The inline AI search should appear in the search dashboard
4. All dropdowns and functionality should work as expected

## Technical Details

### Architecture

```
AISmartSearchInline extends AISmartSearchEnhanced
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reuses all dropdown creation methods
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reuses search execution logic  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reuses parameter management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Adds inline-specific rendering and sync
```

### Key Methods

- `renderInline(container)`: Renders the interface into a container
- `syncToHiddenForm()`: Syncs parameters to hidden form elements
- `updateFields(params)`: Updates interface when parameters change externally
- `executeSearch()`: Executes search with parameter synchronization

### Integration Points

- **CardSearchPanel**: Hidden form elements maintain compatibility
- **MapManager**: Drawing and geometry display integration
- **CollectionManager**: Dynamic collection loading and selection
- **StateManager**: URL state management and sharing
- **GeometrySync**: Synchronization between interfaces

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- All existing search functionality is preserved
- Hidden form elements maintain API compatibility  
- Search execution logic unchanged
- State management and URL sharing still work

### Original AI Button

- The fullscreen AI Smart Search Enhanced is still available
- Click the AI button (üß†) in the dashboard header for fullscreen mode
- Both interfaces share the same underlying logic

## Customization

### Styling

Modify `css/ai-smart-search-inline.css` to customize:
- Colors and gradients for fields
- Typography and spacing
- Animations and transitions
- Responsive breakpoints

### Functionality  

Extend `AISmartSearchInline` to add:
- Custom field types
- Additional parameters
- Custom dropdown content
- Integration with other services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Interface doesn't render**: Check console for import errors
2. **Dropdowns don't open**: Verify CSS files are loaded correctly  
3. **Search doesn't work**: Check if hidden form elements are properly synced
4. **Collections don't load**: Verify API client and collection manager setup

### Debug Tools

```javascript
// Access components from browser console
window.stacExplorer.aiSmartSearchInline.getCurrentParameters()
window.stacExplorer.aiSmartSearchInline.updateFields({collection: 'test'})
```

## Performance

### Optimizations

- Lazy loading of collections in background
- Efficient dropdown positioning calculations
- Minimal DOM manipulation for updates
- Reuse of existing logic to minimize code duplication

### Memory Management

- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Dropdown elements removed from DOM when closed
- Component cleanup method for proper teardown

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
